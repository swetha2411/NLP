Great for productivity, but not the best for gaming.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"To be clear, the i3-12100f performs as an excellent desktop processor for what it is, and if you're going to use it mainly for office tasks, browsing, YouTube, it'll do all of that effortlessly, and efficiently so at near or around half the wattage of it's Ryzen counterpart.Once you cross into PC gaming territory, results can be mixed. You have to be very careful about which GPU is paired with this i3 to prevent noticeable bottlenecks. I tried a few combinations, given how touted this was as a such a good budget option, and while it always seemed to work decent in GPU intensive games, CPU intensive games always suffered and exhibited massive amounts of stuttering and fps drops, even if the resolution was raised to 1440p and settings favored GPU. For reference I was using higher end cards to test, such as an MSI Trio RX 6800 and an EVGA RTX 3070 FTW3, and yes, I was aware it would bottleneck to begin with, but was hoping it would not be as severe as it was to serve as a temporary fix until I could upgrade later in the year. Many reviewers also glowed about how it could be paired with more high-end GPUs, but this clearly isn't the case for some games. Fortnite is one example that suffered massively. I wouldn't recommend pairing this with anything more than an RX 6600, RTX 3060, or something slightly older such as a GTX 1660 TI.",,,,,,,,,,,

If you're looking for a steady 60-75fps this CPU would pair well with any GPU up to a 6700xt or 3060ti in all but the most CPU intensive games (you may notice occasional dips in something like Cyberpunk). For general computing use it's more than adequate. It also run very cool using the stock cooler (doesn't go over 65Â° while gaming).For the $106 I paid I couldn't be happier, but I'll probably upgrade to an i5-12400/13400 when I get a more power GPU and/or a higher refresh rate monitor.",,,,,,,,,,,

Better than the Ryzen 5 5500!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing.

IdÃ©al pour les jeux et le multimÃ©dia.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cette 12Ã¨me gÃ©nÃ©ration de processeurs Intel est dÃ©cidÃ©ment excellente !Depuis 20 ans, je n'avais achetÃ© que du AMD, mais Ã  le lecture de nombreux tests qui avaient mis en avant les qualitÃ©s du 12100F, j'avais donc dÃ©cidÃ© de franchir le pas.Au dÃ©part, je voulais un processeur Ã  la fois suffisamment puissant dans les jeux, et qui ne chauffe pas (et donc qui ne consomme pas). DÃ©jÃ  parce qu'il Ã©tait destinÃ© Ã  Ãªtre placÃ© dans un HTPC, ayant par essence un airflow un peu compliquÃ©, et ensuite car je souhaitais optimiser le rapport performances/Ã©nergie.Je pense que c'est mission accomplie.

Sachez qu'elle a autant de rÃ©pondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.Pour rÃ©sumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destinÃ© Ã  un usage polyvalent et Ã©conomique.",,,,,,,,,,,

CPU OK--Cooler is Worthless",3.0 out of 5 stars,So far the CPU works as expected.  The included Intel CPU cooler is completely useless.  The installation process is obscure and the mounting system is terrible.  Basically plastic pop rivets which hold the fan to the motherboard.  The cooler did not work and the CPU temperature was almost 90 C.  The motherboard would not let me load software because of the high temperature warning.  I replaced the Intel unit with an after market cooler that works very well.  CPU temperature in now in the mid 20's.  A very disappointing experience and I think that I will use AMD processors next time.,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, I had read about and was expecting to have thermal issues with the stock cooler until I received the water cooler I ordered, but the cooler has had no problems keeping the CPU cool under load.

The multi core performance is fantastic as well. I have a â€œnon-Fâ€ version in a workstation and this 12400F in a gaming rig (yes, I liked it enough to buy a second one.) Itâ€™s great for both use cases. I have it paired with an RTX 3080ti for gaming, and most of the time the CPU load is well under 50%. My favorite game only uses 1-4% of the processor lol. For reference, I game at 4K with maxed settings on a 55â€ TV, so at 1080p or 1440p, there may be more load shifted to the CPU. Still, I wouldnâ€™t expect it to break a sweat under most titles, including AAA titles. Buy with confidence, and donâ€™t fall victim to anyone telling you that you need an i9 to game. Itâ€™s just not necessary unless maybe you are a designer who wants just one computer that has the CPU horsepower for work and also can game in your spare time.",,,,,,,,,,,

Fantastic for what it is. Solid choice for gaming.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off if you do NOT have a dedicated GPU make sure to get the non-f version! The 12400f is a solid choice, and this is a great time to snag one. It's LGA 1700 so any motherboards that can use this CPU can also upgrade to 13th gen, and MAYBE even 14th gen.. all be it with BIOS updates. So if you need a ""hold over"" until you can go 13th or 14th gen. The 12400 / 12400f is an absolute terrific choice.",,,,,,,,,,,

Horrible Efficiency",1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately.

UPDATE: Been at this for days and days. Intel core i9-14900k on ASUS z790 Strix is a BSOD MACHINE. Previouslyit would run for many minutes. Now it barely goes one ir two minutes before freezing and a BSOD. Now I'm doing ASUS BIOS MemTest86 so far so good (for the RAM).While Windows 11 Pro was working I did the Memory Diagnostics and it said it passed.

All drivers up and Windows are up to date.I've not done any overclocking or XMP in the bios to push the RAM 4000Mhz to the advertised 6400. I avoided buying RAM that can go 8000Mhz with XMP because there are so very many failures with those--and I wanted 8000 because I wanted a system with no bottlenecks as much as possible.Runs great for about 5 to 30 minutes. Temps run from 30s to 50s to high 80s bouncing up and down like normal. Then BOOM BSODs.I will do tests including memory, cpu, and double check drivers.Most websites point to a CPU issue. Some mention RAM or drivers.I'm either going to solve this issue or return this i9-14900 CPU and replace it with an i9-13900.I hope to remember this review and update it with success info.",,,,,,,,,,,

BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket",1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built.",,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.

E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade.

i9 CPU Instability and Degradation - Buyer Beware",1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"purchased the i9 CPU six months ago with high expectations for top-tier performance. Initially, it lived up to those expectations, running smoothly for about four months. However, my experience took a turn for the worse when instability issues began to plague my system.Games started crashing randomly to the desktop, and I encountered frustrating VRAM errors in Fortnite, which are known issues with 13th and 14th gen i9 CPUs. I soon realized that my motherboard's default settings were likely to blame, as they inadvertently cooked my CPU, causing it to degrade rapidly over a short period. Despite my efforts to disable overclocking features like ASUS Multicore Enhancement, the motherboard continued to apply overclocks, exacerbating the problem.In response to widespread complaints, Intel and motherboard manufacturers released BIOS updates touted to fix the issue by reducing power limits, known as the Intel Baseline Defaults profile. Initially, this seemed to restore stability to my system, but the respite was short-lived. After about a month, the same issues resurfaced, casting doubt on the effectiveness of the solution.I am currently dealing with Intel support over this CPU, and I have a case number with them as we work to resolve the ongoing issues. The fact that these issues are still ongoing and Intel is actively investigating the root cause speaks to the severity and complexity of the problem.Based on my experience and the prevalence of similar issues, I urge potential buyers to think carefully before investing in the i9 CPU. Considering the reported stability of i7 CPUs, it may be a safer choice for those prioritizing reliability.",,,,,,,,,,,

Do NOT buy 14th Gen i9's",1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"Hey all,I built my most recent rig with the following specs:CPU: i9-14900kMotherboard: MSI Carbon WiFi II Z-790RAM: 64 gig rip jaw low profile (certified compliant by MSI)Cooler: Dark Rock Pro 5GPU: ROG 4070Ti SuperPower Supply: Rog Thor 850w PlatinumCase: Corsair 4000DThis rig should be a monster, but because Intel has misled the general public, it is completely unstable and blue screens multiple times per day. These 14th-generation chips are trash. They are fraught with instability issues, and the news worsens as time progresses. We have been through three motherboards, three different sets of RAM, and two different GPUs, and the problems continue.Now, I have to decide if I can be without my rig for several weeks to try to RMA the chip via Intel. The worst part of all this is a crap shoot if I receive an actual working chip back. Again, it does not appear to be the chip itself but the instruction/algorithm Intel uses.Motherboard manufacturers are allowing these chips, by default, to run off the rails. Intel's power spec is 253W. When I checked the BIOS on my motherboard(s), they come by default set to run at just under 5000W! Are you kidding me? If you are not a really good problem solver with these things. I do not see the average consumer having any understanding of why their rig is acting like a crazy person.Anyway, just do yourselves a favor and take a big ol' pass on these chips. They are not worth it. Stick with your old chips until the next gen comes out or just switch over to AMD.@Intel; you have to stop being the Boeing of the Chip world. You were once a great company with high standards, and now you are just imping for your shareholders. Get it together, and start doing things right.

"until the kinks are worked out, not even a little bit worth the price.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.",,,,,,,,,,,

Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.

Thermal throttle spikes not present with 13900k",3.0 out of 5 stars,"My 13900k never thermal throttled in any game, yet I'm getting thermal throttle spikes when playing games like Cyberpunk with the 14900k. My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone.

"4.0 out of 5 stars
Insane performance at a cost",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly.",,,,,,,,,,,
"4.0 out of 5 stars
Main improvement is lower power cost day-day",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway. AI image generation/training - GPU, video rendering/editing/transcoding - GPU, even audio processing/correction is done on GPU these days.",,,,,,,,,,,
"4.0 out of 5 stars
Fast, but unstable when overclocked.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip.",,,,,,,,,,,

Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version.",,,,,,,,,,,

Excellent performance for general purpose use",4.0 out of 5 stars,As a Gamer/Data Scientist/Programmer/Tinker I wanted a mainstream CPU built by a well established company.

A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience.",,,,,,,,,,,

Intel has a long way to go.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"To start, this is a great CPU. I consistently maintain 5.4-5.6 GHz without entering overclocking territory. I paired it with an MSI Suprim X 4070ti, and they destroy 1440p together. However, this is obviously a refresh and NOT a new generation. Performance gains are limited and to get there they raised TDP and thus it runs HOT. I have a 240mm AIO and its.. fine. It's just disappointing that this is how Intel responds to competition.

Cool stock, hot with unlocked TDP limits",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I love and hate this CPU. Out of the box with stock intel specs it runs cool on a 360mm AIO but really hardly any gains over a 13900k. This is not a new generation so intel should have done what they have done in the past and call this a 13990k or even 13970k like they did back in the Devils Canyon release (4790k upgraded from 4770k)on a 13900k if you unlock the TDP limits through features like Asus Multicore Enhancement (or manually remove the TDP limits) it basically performs within margin of error of the 14900k stock limits if not beats it on longer test when Intel limits are reached (10min loop of Cinebench R23 for example).If you unlock the limits of the 14900k you start getting thermal throttling with high core count benchmarks and then it actually can perform worse than the 13900k with unlocked limits because the 13900k will hold 5.5ghz but the 14900k will bounce between 5.2-5.6ghz.I had to set the power use limits to 320w in the BIOS to get it to reliably match or sometimes beat the 13900k with unlocked TDP limits.Where this CPU can shine is if you are into undervolting. I suspect there is some headroom there.If you are air cooling the CPU or even a 240mm AIO you probably need to keep this on the stock intel TDP limits and would be fine.To really get the most out of the 14900k I would say you need a custom loop, otherwise just get a 13900k and unlock the TDP limits with a 360mm AIO cooler. Still 4 stars because it is basically a 13900k. I would give the 13900k 5 stars.If the 14900k was much more expensive I would probably downgrade it to a 3 star CPU. They basically are asking for what the 13900k cost so it seems like a fair tradeoff.",,,,,,,,,,,

However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâ€”Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâ€”Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâ€”achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâ€”increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ€”4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....  Depends what needs done, either/or is screaming fast even 55ns at that Bandwidth.",,,,,,,,,,,

IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3. FDXGYH 4 Pcs CPU Heatsink Fan Buckle PC Mainboard CPU Radiator Fan 12CM Wire Buckle Upper Hook Type Fixing Clip  (these buckles are compatible with noctus 140mm fans)4. Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :(",,,,,,,,,,,

i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years.",,,,,,,,,,,

I MADE IT WORK",5.0 out of 5 stars,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .,,,,,,,,,,,

Much faster than my previous i7-6850k",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!",,,,,,,,,,,

Powerful but Warm",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360.

Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,

Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!

So far so good.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.",,,,,,,,,,,

This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3).

Died after a couple of weeks of use.,1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"I put together a gaming PC collecting parts over time as I had funds to purchase. Finally put it all together and it ran well for about 2 weeks and then I began having blue-screen crashes. Now it won't even complete a windows install on a clean drive without crashing. Tried two mother boards, 6 memory sticks, 3 NVMe drives, and two power supplies before being forced to realize the processor is causing my issue. I am now out of the quick return path grace period and must try to RMA through Amazon. If you buy one of these chips, or any part for that matter, use it right away in case it is a bad part.< Time Passes > It has been a number of months since I wrote the first part of this review and replaced this bad processor with a new identical one.

"Run dual displays smoothly without any hiccups, here are my notesâ€¦",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,
Undervolt your intel CPU!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The morning after building and setting up windows, drivers, etc. The PC had blue screened because of temperatures, and after a reset and entering the BIOS I saw that the temperature was 89 degrees celsius.

"great product, customer service not bad but not perfect",4.0 out of 5 stars,"the one i bought one year ago had instability. didn't know it was the CPU until it really started acting up. had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the CPU. When i reached out to Intel, they Informed me about a policy about ''tray'' processor and ''boxed'' processor. basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they don't cover warranty. As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor. It was a bit unnerving, but at the en, they offered me the warranty and i'm supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them.",,,,,,,,,,,
Money Value is there but 13600k is better,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",,,,,,,,,,,
Good overall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much to say about this cpu. It's Intel, and these are immortal. Still have the 3770K I got like 10 years ago, and an Extreme I got even earlier than that.So the main motive here is to let Amazon know that I HAVE received the item, but I don't know how to let them know so they can change the ""package left at mail"" to ""Already received""...",,,,,,,,,,,
"Fast and powerful, graphics not great",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this K to have graphics backup. The CPU is great the graphics not so much. Still I do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my PC, but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed. So for that purpose it works. The cost vs the KF is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good CPU.",,,,,,,,,,,

Potente ma caldino,4.0 out of 5 stars,Volevo dare 5 stelle perchÃ© il processore Ã¨ sulla carta eccellemte e anche dei benchmark. Mi risulta perÃ² che si ferma al. 90 percento come se avesse un incompatibilitÃ  con la mia asus z690 a gaming. Ancora non ho ben capito quindi do 4 stelle.Nonostante quwtso piccolo limite mi va il 40 percento di piÃ¹ rispetto a un 11 gen.Quindi soddisfatto.Temperature alte se non usate un raffreddamento a liquido.Io uso un corsair h100 che Ã¨ molto potente.Valutate un raffreddamento a liquido per quetso processore,,,,,,,,,,,

Got unlucky first chip,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got a bad one.  Worked like crazy trying to figure out the issue and on board video was working some but not always.  Sent it back and got another that works amazing. Water coolers don't have the correct spacer for this chip but I checked the website and got one for under 10.  So factor that into your water cooling cost.,,,,,,,,,,,
Great CPU for gaming and multitasking,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great CPU so far. Only limiting this CPU at the moment is the early versions of Z690 motherboard software that might not be overclocking at optimal levels (using auto overclock). Make sure you have a good CPU cooler or a cooler designed for the LGA 1700. Currently the Gigabyte settings for overclocking (bios or windows app) is pushing the CPU above spec and will cause throttling. I am using a Corsair H150i Elite CAPELLIX 360mm.Amazon delivery was late even with paying for the express option at check out,,,,,,,,,,,

works great,5.0 out of 5 stars,"the CPU works great and is super fast.  i didn't really want to pay for the latest and greatest, mainly because i have found that a 10% increase can add 50% to the price of the CPU.  one thing to watch out for, there is no cooling fan in this package, so you have to buy one.  you can get the CPU with a fan, but it's a different part number.  personally, even though it cost more to buy the fan separately, i believe the Noctua cooler i got will work much better than anything Intel provides.",,,,,,,,,,,
Ridiculously fast,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this overclocked at 5.0 GHz for a couple weeks now and it hasn't skipped a beat. I bought an MSI Z690 MPG Edge Motherboard to pair with this beast of a chip. Keep in mind, it does NOT come with a cooler so make sure you have a reputable thermal paste and a solid cooler to pair with this. I have a pre-filled watercooler (Corsair Hydro Series H115i Pro) which is giving me temps idle as low as 19Â°C (not joking, look at the picture). Under full load, I have yet to hit over 50Â°C even gaming at 1440p (2k resolution). If I'm being quite honest, this CPU is overkill for gaming. If you have the extra money, go for it. If not, a i5-12600k will be just as powerful for less money.",,,,,,,,,,,
intel still proves to be a realible brand,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've bounced over years from AMD to INTEL and at one point settled back to INTEL.  I typically go for the i7 processors to get more life out of my systems (rather than i3 or i5 processors).  I have gotten many more years than thought out of systems and still show good usability even after 6 years.  The processor installs easily provided you have some knowledge in building computers.  No blue screening to report used with ASUS Z690M-Plus motherboard and G.SKILL memory.,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome CPU,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My last PC CPU was an intel 9700k and while gaming-wise the performance doesn't seem much higher. I obviously get a few more FPS, but it has not been so noticeable. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a blind test. However, this CPU is just amazing for every other task and overall I am happy with it.Paired with the Asus B660-I Gaming board and 32gb of DDR5 5200mhz RAM and I'm truly satisfied with my rig performance so far. There are no hiccups or anything else really holding the PC from absolutely crushing anything I throw at it.",,,,,,,,,,,
Best CPU thus far,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Many people can argue AMD this or AMD that, or Intel i9, but if you're wanting something to start off at the high-end level, I would highly recommend this CPU. Granted, you should get a good CPU cooler or a decent liquid cooler that will keep the CPU cold. Other than that, this offers great performance despite the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,
i7-12700K vs i5-13600K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was deciding between i7-12700k and the i5-13600k.Nearly identical performance on all benchmarks.There is a very slight edge to the i5-13600k in gaming performance.But, the i7-12700k runs a bit cooler and uses less load in gaming, saving you electricity.The i7-12700k is also faster in Photoshop.Overall, they are very similar in performance, but, since the i7-12700k is a bit less expensive, it offered a better value.But, you can't go wrong with either one.",,,,,,,,,,,
Luck of the draw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lost the silicon lottery. My CPU doesn't clock as high as advertised out of the box. Requires very extreme over lock settings to achieve 5 ghz.Edit: Changed my cooler from deepcool 360ex to deepcool ls520, huge improvement. 5.2Ghz on 2 favourite cores and 5.0Ghz all core on an extended 3d rendering workload with highest temps btwn 85-94C.",,,,,,,,,,,

"5.0 out of 5 stars
A superb piece of a processor",5.0 out of 5 stars,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",,,,,,,,,,,

Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max.

The best CPU I've owned so far. Rivaling even the 5900X! Intel is killing the game as of now.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!",,,,,,,,,,,

I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip.",,,,,,,,,,,

Great product/Brand Intel i7 CPU,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product/Brand Intel i7 CPU. I have been using the Intel brand CPU's and have been using the i7 and the K series since they were introduced.

Pretty good value for the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome upgrade and great value,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to the Coffee Lake generation I had been (willingly) stuck on for 4 years this is a massive leap. Before buying I was a bit skeptical since I'm not a fan of Intel's newer way of handling cores, but the first thing I tried when I got it was emulating PS3 games and right off the bat I saw compile times cut tenfold and stability at least doubled.The older CPUs from the 8th, 9th, and 10th gen are perfectly usable for most people so if you're on a budget maybe look on the used market for those. But if you really need something powerful this is a good option.",,,,,,,,,,,

Had an IMC function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed.  Couldn't run any XMP profiles, and swapping the processor solved it (not a Mobo issue).Just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen, and return it if *anything* seems even *remotely* off.",,,,,,,,,,,

Great CPU,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this for a new personal PC. My last was an i7 4790K build that got totaled out (crushed) during shipping. After building a new one on a z790i platform, the performance gain was stunning, completely night and day! I cannot say enough about this CPU, and would totally recommend this product!!",,,,,,,,,,,
Watch the price on this one,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)",,,,,,,,,,,
Works Great!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,
A better deal for most people vs. the i9,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been planning to hold off for Raptor Lake, but my Z370 mobo died, and I decided to go ahead and get an Alder Lake i7.  So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.  The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+  over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems.",,,,,,,,,,,

The new LGA 1700 boards have an added benefit compared to the aging AM4 boards. This CPU support PCIe 5.0 and DDR4 or DDR5 RAM. I like how efficient Intel designed it because the P cores are optimized for gaming while the efficient E cores deal with the background tasks. Make sure to buy a good AIO cooler because the CPU will run hot when there is lots of load! Please note a new Intel CPU will come with its Intel factory seal outside the box.

Unit was previously opened....,1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,

high price with bad warranty service and bad quality,1.0 out of 5.0 out of 5 stars stars,"It does not worth buying this CPU. It is really expensive.

So far, I am not happy but still can convince myself that I am just not lucky even I feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products. I tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it, but Intel's customer service is ridiculous slow. After we tell them the issue, it has been a month and they are still verifying our information. it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need. We sent them the information immediately. It took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong. We gave them the correct information immediately. This time, it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good, but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty  (why do not you tell us this at beginning?). After this, it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now. I do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information. Should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour? I understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams, but it still takes too long time.

"Works great so far, maybe pre owned??",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Came packaged kinda poorly, and didnâ€™t include the golden coin case, which makes me think maybe it was pre owned.

So many cores to use!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too.",,,,,,,,,,,
Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250.",,,,,,,,,,,
Just about the best gaming chip you don't need!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Aside from the nightmare Alder Lake is with ram clocking, this thing does everything you need to.

Only worth on sale,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The tenth gen i9 is better than this one, but I got it because my mobo needed it for the m.2 slot to work. That being said, we're talking about small performance differences in top of the line components, so it's not a big deal. With this thing being $650 without a sale I would never buy it because I can get an i7 from the same gen or previous and it will be just as good. I will say that the photo is deceptive, it does not come in the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box. It will come in a cardboard box like any other CPU. Overall it's still a great CPU and is a great upgrade from my previous i5 8600k, but not the absolute best and not worth paying $600 for.",,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent value if it were priced lower,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The 11th gen flagship i9 was a major step backwards in specs.  CPUs with 8 cores and 16 threads have recently been reserved for i7 SKUs.  Intel last-minute scaled this CPU back because of constraints with the older 14nm process.At launch, this CPU was a terrible value.  As of now, if you shop around you can find this CPU bundled with a Z590 motherboard at a very fair price.  I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard.  This suddenly changes the 11900K to being an excellent value.  It works extremely well but remember that 12th and 13th gen Intel i7/i9 will blow this out of the water.",,,,,,,,,,,
A little disappointed in the packaging.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"CPU is great. Not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end PC. Performance is similar to the 10900k but has the PCIe gen 4 support which is the only justification for this CPU existance. This with a new z590 and depending if you already have DDR4 ram, this is 1/3 the cost of a new 12th existence.I will admit I am very disappointed in the box. The nice fancy one pictured is not the one sent. Instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with Intel branding. It should be make clear that the box in the picture will not be arriving in the description or by updating the imgages.",,,,,,,,,,,

Great Processor But Can Run Hot Unless Tuned!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running PC. Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc.  After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85.  This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game).  With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%.  This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!Happy that I can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade!",,,,,,,,,,,

Still a great gaming CPU even after 3 generations.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins).  The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200.  By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs.  This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today.",,,,,,,,,,,

I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022  performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100Â°C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional  independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure. Overall I am extremely satisfied with INTEL in general and recommend the i9-11900K and or its newer siblings now as a very good buy!",,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing product,5.0 out of 5 stars,"amazing product, and the shipping was excellent, however the box in the image isnt what you get in person, its just the standard box you usually get.",,,,,,,,,,,
A really good value from Intel for Intel based motherboards. It is capable of overclocking.,5.0 out of 5 stars,This LGA 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard supports overclocking and your cpu cooler supports it. The base 3.5 GHz can easily support overclocking to 5GHz. I used the Intel Windows overclocking program and it was easy to do. The cpu installs easily and runs well.,,,,,,,,,,,
Super cpu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"J'ai enfin changer mon 6700k , jusqu'Ã  maintenant je l'adore, avec un bon cooling il est super stable ! J'ai rien de nÃ©gatif Ã  dire",,,,,,,,,,,
i9 11900K to the rescue,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had an i7 10700 that went kaput on me, so I figured, why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900K, since it was only about 50 bucks more to the the fastest CPU my mobo can handle. I did install water cooling because it does run warm, but letâ€™s just say this. My computer now works at warp 9.975. With the i9 10900k, a Nvidia 3060/12gb, and 128 GB DDR4 at 3200mhz, on userbenchmark website the lowest score I got was a 104% for gaming (UFO ranking). I overclock it a lot and it holds up well, and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me.11/10, would recommend, promote ahead of peers.",,,,,,,,,,,
What a deal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgraded from i5....LOL what a friggin improvement....WowVideo editing sure isn't an issue now. Blows my mind,,,,,,,,,,,
Great CPU,5.0 out of 5 stars,"when i upgraded my desktop i decided to go intel core i9 this time. all my previous build was a 6th generation core i7 6700k. it ran fine but it wasnt up to running windows 11. so an upgrade was in order. besides, my old board was starting to fail. i originally bought a 10th generation core i9 10 core but that cpu  was junk. there wasnt enough PCI-e Lanes to support my drives and usb devices. this is a limitation of 10th generation CPUs not a limitation on the board. my video card (RTX 3070) took up most of the available PCI-e lanes which took out most of my drives. so i went to the 11th generation i9 8 core instead. very happy with it. it solved all my PCI-e lane issues. i am able to run all my devices and drives. the cpu clocks at 5.3ghz stable i have water cooling installed. i see zero problems with this chip. its fast, its stable im plenty happy with the upgrade. the board is a MSI MEG z590 ACE Gold. i have 64gb DDR4 3200.",,,,,,,,,,,
As it should be!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Had this for a while and it's performing like it should. Would buy it  again.,,,,,,,,,,,
5.3ghz paired with gen 4 nvme is pure speed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If seen too many of these new i9's and i7's put in b550 boards or anything with an LGA 1200 slot and its a waste! This is the newest of the new guys, if you get this cpu do it proper, if youre not gonna shoot for utilizing its capabilities then get a 10th gen and save money. Youre gonna need a new board, water cool this thing, gen 4 nvme drive, new 30 series gpu's (cause they utilize gen 4 pci-e slots) heres a simple breakdown of a good starting point when getting this cpu:Step 1: get an 11th gen processor (this i9 if its in your budget)Step 2: get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots (z590-e was my go to)Step 3: obviously water cool this unlocked beauty cause it'd be a shame not to get it to 5.3ghz (done safely with corsair's H150i elite capellix; hovers around 40's in degrees Celsius)Step 4: get a gen 4 nvme solid slate drive (might as well go samsung 980 pro for the 7000mb/s reads)Step 5: enjoy windows booting and being able to start opening webpages and games within 5 seconds of pressing the power button and never waiting for anything to load ever again ðŸ™ŒðŸ™âš¡ This is the future âš¡",,,,,,,,,,,
Might be a defective CPU but dang this thing makes heat..,5.0 out of 5 stars,The seller did an amazing job.The item came even sooner than expected.The bad news is that I installed it in my previously flawless running machine. The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work.I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell. I decided to upgrade to a liquid CPU cooler and that brought my CPU temp down to around 85c.That still didn't fix the time out errors. I put my old CPU back and all is happy. I ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45% overclock. LOL,,,,,,,,,,,
"Product is as ordered, shipping was bad.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Products operates as expected, but they shipped this really oddly. It was first shipped ups, and stayed in a picked up status for 2 days. Then a day or so later, delivered to usps. Sat in Des Moines IA for 4 days. Then it crawled to me well after predicted time. Don't ship this way. Its the worst way too ship. Also you shipped it in a Thin bubble wrap bag. Should have been in a box. Its a fragile chip, but thank you for a good working product with no issues as of yet.",,,,,,,,,,,
Surprising level of performance; use a liquid cooler for best performance.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this CPU during one of Amazon's infrequent and short-lived major price reductions. I paid $301.99 for the CPU at the time when it was selling for $389.99.  I wanted PCIe 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4.0 and I was considering a 5900X but I found the AMD X570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end. Anyway, I usually buy Intel Processors although I've occasionally bought AMD in the past.  I have a very good Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360 CPU Liquid Cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool.  I also bought an ASUS Z590 MAXIMUS XIII HERO motherboard, everything is faster with this CPU and motherboard, from storage to graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,
Is what it is.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As others stated it is not in the box being shown, so the advertised product is not what you get.However the good thing is the box doesnt mean squat to how it runs.Just grabbed this to upgrade my system from a 10th gen i9 to this, only difference really is faster pcie slots on my board (this would depend on your board) and opens up an additional nvme drive.",,,,,,,,,,,
"Overkill, even for flight simulation",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Having eight cores and hyperthreading makes for a very powerful processor. This is a very good ""overkill"" processor; that is to say, if you get this you'll outpace software for several years. It also has onboard graphics, so if you're buying this for rendering and just light computing, you'll be okay and won't have to buy a discrete graphics card like a GeForce.That said, this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use, so a cooler is recommended. I use a liquid cooler, but if you're not using it for heavy gaming, you can get away with just a fan.Overall, 10/10.",,,,,,,,,,,

Great cpu for the $300 i paid for,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far Iâ€™m really liking this cpu. I purchased it on prime day for $300 which imo isnâ€™t too bad compared to what it used to be and how expensive the 12 gen cpus are.Paired it with the z590 asus strix E that i got for $200 on prime days. Itâ€™s working out pretty well.Also threw in the 3600 cl16 ram with it as this ram apparently runs well with it.Overall Iâ€™m pretty happy with this purchase,,,,,,,,,,,
Quiet and Cool,5.0 out of 5 stars,Installed the i9 11900k in the ASUS Prime Z590-P WiFi6 with Team group DDR4 3200 CL14 and ASUS RTX 2070 has this computer running less than a whisper of sound I mean even when the PC ramps up to 5.3GHz then you hear still a whisper from all fans you really need to pay attention to the PC to even notice any sound at all.,,,,,,,,,,,
Blazing fast new architecture,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This CPU is fast, really fast.  Remove the power limits and let it's boost algorithms take over and it will blow your socks off.

I went with the Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML240 Illusion, ordered an extra 2 of the Hallo Fans and set it up in a Push/Pull and under stress test8ng it stays in the 80s (with all power limits removed) while gaming it is usually in the 50's and occasionally the 60's if it is really intense.It is a tad on the pricey end but you want almost the same performance for less grab the 11700k",,,,,,,,,,,

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.",,,,,,,,,,,

Not necessary for everyone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",,,,,,,,,,,

"Best CPU I've owned, Lowest temps and usage",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing never goes over 15 percent usage, and most games its actually using 0-4 percent. Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs. I'm really shocked on how good its performance is, Definitely recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,

Thing is pretty nuts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've only had it about a month, but so far it is complete overkill for gaming... I haven't seen it go above 50% pushing it as hard as I can other than stress testing lol. I bought it so hopefully in 10 years it can still do some stuff hahaha.",,,,,,,,,,,
i9-12900K an excellent buy itï¼ï¼,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny.",,,,,,,,,,,
Great Upgrade from 9900K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,

"With the new price, this item (New CPU) is now a value",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It took me less than 15 minutes to take out my current 1700 series CPU (i7 12700K) and add in this new one.  Removed the AIO cooler, cleaned off the thermal paste, applied new past after inserting and wala' it's up and running like a champ.  I'm not a gamer, so yes I understand it's not a huge bump in performance for those applications. Video Editing is another story.",,,,,,,,,,,
Be careful,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first PC build I chose this chip and I didnâ€™t know it runs that hot I built my PC I had enough fans but I had a 240 mm radiator I want a Micro Center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool. The temps were at 89 to 92Â°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60Â°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%. Itâ€™s pretty overkill but thatâ€™s how I like my PC.",,,,,,,,,,,
12th Gen Top Tier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase (this was actually cheaper than the i7).Paired with RTX 4060TI 8GB.NO regrets.This can handle anything I throw at it, without issue (gaming wise) and never goes above 50/55C (not overclocked and cooled with 240MM AIO from Corsair) Idles around 32/33CVery responsive with plenty of clearance if I ever want to OC this guy.Heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240MM radiator (sitting over a 4060Ti), but no issues - heat or performance) at all.Great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently.",,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing CPU,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",,,,,,,,,,,

Insanely fast computation!,5.0 out of 5 stars,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming.

i9 Smooths as butter!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome Cpu blazzzing fast !!!!!!  for gaming and other  tasks . i see that the temps for this cpu work up into the 70's and even higher 80 + my recommendation is to undervote your cpu if your just gaming that will lower temps. With good thermal paste Kingpin cooling KPX and a water cooler im getting 55-58c in gaming hope it helps.,,,,,,,,,,,
It works,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure if I bought the best in terms of value and performance!,,,,,,,,,,,
Potente!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Potente, velocidad, gran desempeÃ±o... De verdad una gran maravilla lo que hace este procesador.",,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,The processor is amazing. Upgraded from an Intel 8700k.  Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard  and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios. Blows away anything currently AMD is offering in the same price range.,,,,,,,,,,,
Incredible cpu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's nothing more to say, if you only want gaming get an i7, unless you're into emulation that's the only instance where you'll get an actual edgeIt runs pretttty hot as it takes over 250 watts if it can, in my case over 270 so keep that in mind",,,,,,,,,,,
Realmente veloz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Llevaba 10 aÃ±os trabajando con Xeon, y tengo que aclarar que han sido procesadores excelentes y duraderos, pero necesitaba actualizarme a un procesador que fuera mÃ¡s rÃ¡pido y he tomado la desiciÃ³n correcta con este i9. Trabajo en diseÃ±o en general, ediciÃ³n de vÃ­deo, animaciÃ³n y 3D, donde existe un beneficio gracias a su potencia, todo se mueve como mantequilla.",,,,,,,,,,,
Awesome,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a huge upgrade to my system for good price. Im back into the modern pc world. Win 11 runs great,,,,,,,,,,,
As of 9/6/2022 this is the GOD of processors. If you want the BEST available this is it!,5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is truly impressive. It also comes in a very shiny golden container. It makes you happy the moment you open the package. As far as I have researched this is the absolute best and most powerful processor on the market as or 9/6/2022. I definitely recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,
Insanely Fast Processor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this processor, it can handle anything I throw at it. The only thing I was concerned with, is that I bought it 'new', but the stickers were peeled off the Intel 12900k box, so I am not sure what was up with that, it looked like it still had the safety seal on it though, but at least it works.",,,,,,,,,,,
Excellent CPU,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It will handle all your multitasking needs with ease, even while gaming.Only con I can think of is that it does run very hot so you'll need a high end cooler to get the best performance",,,,,,,,,,,
